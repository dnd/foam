08/29/2002 - v1.1.2
	Fixed PopulateComboBoxes() to check that the tmpPath is not an empty string prior to parsing.

========================================================================================================
08/04/2002 - v1.1.0
	Added "New Procedure" button to clear out all fields and have a fresh slate for a new XML file.
	
	"Parse XML" will now prompt the user when clicked, asking if the user would like to clear out all 
	fields, essentially creating a new procedure. If the user responds "No" then the existing data will 
	be kept, but drop down options for ORDER BY and Constraint Clauses will be repopulated. The prompt 
	will only appear if another document has already been parsed during	the session.
	
	When an XML doc path is typed in, or attained using the Browse button, the file will be parsed 
	automatically.

08/03/2002 - v1.0.0 
	Released.
