		<h2>About Foam</h2>
		<p>Foam is a .Net Windows application that is used to ease the creation of FOR XML 
			EXPLICIT queries for use with MS SQL Server 2000. Foam does this by taking an 
			XML document that you have formatted according to the incredibly simple 
			structure specified below, and then parsing through the document to create the 
			appropriate FOR XML EXPLICIT structure. This is the absolute base functionality 
			of Foam.
			<BR>
			<BR>
			With Foam, you can further specify parameters, constraints(FROM/WHERE clauses), 
			and ORDER BY criteria. Foam will take the information that it has been given, 
			and format it, and place it in the appropriate location for the stored 
			procedure.
			<br>
			<br>
			While Foam cannot hope to cover all the snags of working with FOR XML EXPLICIT, 
			it does have some rules built in to create the procedure structure as 
			accurately as possible to minimize errors. The more information you provide 
			Foam with, the less chance of errors and need for debugging there will be at 
			the end.
		</p>
		<br>
		<a name="#Requirements"></a>
		<h2>Requirements</h2>
		<p>Foam requires that you have the Microsoft.Net Framework installed, and a 
			resolution display of at least 800x600.
			<ul>
				<li>
					Download the .Net Framework: <a href="http://www.digitalnothing.com/downloads/tools/dotnetfx.exe">
						dotnetfx.exe</a></li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<a name="#Formatting"></a>
		<h2>Formatting your XML File</h2>
		<p>Formatting an XML file for Foam is so simple a monkey could do it(well maybe if 
			you had an infinite number of monkeys...)! To format an XML document for use 
			with Foam, create the XML structure that you would like for your end output. 
			Instead of placing actual data values in for attributes and elements, just 
			place in the column, string, expression, etc... that you would like to have SQL 
			Server use as the value. Look at the Sample.xml file that came with the 
			Foam.zip file for an example of how to format your document.</p>
		<br>
		<a name="#Use"></a>
		<h2>Using Foam</h2>
		<p>First you will need to either type in or use the Browse button to locate the 
			path to the XML document you wish to parse. After you have chosen the file you 
			want to parse, you can specify the name you would like to use for the stored 
			procedure.<br>
			<br>
			In the Parameters section you can add, edit, and remove parameters for the 
			stored procedure. To add a parameter, specify a name, data type, and a length 
			if necessary(no parentheses). Click Add / Edit when you are done. To edit a 
			parameter click on that parameter's line in the parameters list. You may then 
			change the data type, or length and click Add / Edit to save the changes. To 
			remove, select the parameter you wish to remove from the list and click Remove.
			<BR>
			<BR>
			The above are the sections you can fill out before parsing the document you 
			have selected. To make the ORDER BY, and Constraint Clauses groups available, 
			you will need to click the Parse XML button. If the parsing of your document is 
			successful, you will receive a message saying that parsing was successful. If 
			the parsing failed, you will receive a failure message. A failure message 
			indicates that the way you have formatted your document is not in line with 
			what Foam was expecting. Please compare your document with Sample.xml as a 
			reference.<br>
			<br>
			To add ORDER BY criteria to the procedure, select the path to the tag you wish 
			to order by from the drop down, specify whether it should be ascending or 
			descending, and click Add. To edit, or remove, follow the same pattern as 
			described in the Parameters use information. You can move ordered fields up or 
			down in the list to get the appropriate location for a field even if it was 
			added at a later time. To do this, click on the field you want to change, and 
			use the up or down arrow buttons to move the field. It is recommended that you 
			add ORDER BY criteria for your procedure, this is because of the necessity to 
			have the column being ordered by SELECTed in all UNIONs. For more information 
			on how FOR XML EXPLICIT and ORDERing work you can read this article: 
			http://www.sqlxml.org/faqs.aspx?faq=28<br>
			<br>
			To add Constraint Clauses(FROM/WHERE) choose the SELECT block from the drop 
			down that the constraint will be attached to, add your constraints in the 
			textbox, and click Add. To edit or remove a constraint, follow the pattern 
			described in the Parameters use information.<br>
			<br>
			When you are satisfied with the data you have entered, you can click on the 
			Build Procedure button. This will popup a new window from which you can copy or 
			save the generated stored procedure. You always have the option of clicking on 
			the Build Procedure button as long as you have specified the XML document you 
			wish to parse.

		<h2>Development</h2>
		<p>Foam was developed by digital nothing design, because creating FOR XML EXPLICIT 
			queries from the ground up is a major pain in the rear! Anyone who has 
			attempted such knows that this is fact, and not even remotely close to opinion.

		<h2>Resources</h2>
		<p>Below is a list of resources that you may find helpful while attempting to 
			create FOR XML EXPLICIT stored procedures, or even your normal day to day SQL 
			questions.</p>
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="http://www.sqlteam.com">SQL Team</a> - Great articles, and forums with 
				very helpful(read: extremly knowledgeable) regulars. Oh yeah, lots of Yak too!</li>
			<li>
				<a href="http://www.sqlxml.org">SQLXML</a> - Numerous FAQs dealing specifically 
				with building, retrieving, and writing FOR XML queries.</li>
			<li>
				BOL(Books Online) - No link for this one. Just open up Query Analyzer and hit 
				F1.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<p>Now that you are finished reading this little bit of documentation, go have some 
			Foam with your SOAP! ...I'll stop now. Have fun using Foam, hopefully you'll 
			find it as useful as I have.</p>
